Use `asyncio.to_thread()` for file I/O operations\n2. Update server.py to await these methods\n3. Consider using aiofiles for more idiomatic async file I/O\n\n## Notes\n- These operations are generally fast (\u003c10ms) so this is lower priority than the critical fixes\n- The current implementation works but could block briefly during disk I/O\n- This refactor would make the async/sync interface more consistent","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","owner":"turkka.mannila@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-30T11:11:38.336853+02:00","created_by":"Turkka Mannila","updated_at":"2026-01-31T15:24:57.442303+02:00","closed_at":"2026-01-31T15:24:57.442303+02:00","close_reason":"Deferred - critical async fixes complete.

Tests should be:\n- **Atomic**: Each test verifies ONE specific behavior\n- **Fast**: Unit tests mock external dependencies (nix, git, VM processes)\n- **Real**: Integration tests actually spawn microVMs to verify end-to-end functionality\n\n## Components to Test\n\n### 1. Core Modules (Unit Tests)\n\n**Task State Machine** (`core/task.py`)\n- State transitions: PENDING → RUNNING → COMPLETED/FAILED\n- Invalid transitions rejected\n- Thread-safe state updates\n- Task serialization/deserialization (task.json)\n\n**Event Queue** (`core/events.py`)\n- Thread-safe event emission\n- Async waiting with timeouts\n- Multiple waiters receiving same event\n- Cross-thread signaling\n\n**Git Operations** (`core/git.py`)\n- `setup_isolated_repo()`: Creates proper clone with correct remotes\n- `merge_task_commits()`: Fast-forward merge path\n- `merge_task_commits()`: Rebase path when fast-forward fails\n- Conflict detection and preservation at refs/tasks/\u003cid\u003e\n- `cleanup_task_ref()`: Removes refs properly\n- `MergeResult` serialization\n\n**VM Process** (`core/vm.py`)\n- `VMConfig` validation\n- `build_vm()`: nix-build command construction\n- `write_task_files()`: Correct file contents\n- PTY creation and log streaming\n- Exit code capture\n\n### 2. Orchestrator (Integration-ish Tests)\n\n**tools.py - Orchestrator class**\n- Task lifecycle: create → run → complete → cleanup\n- API key retrieval and cleanup\n- Concurrent task handling across slots\n- Error propagation from VM failures\n\n### 3. MCP Tools (Contract Tests)\n\n**server.py - 5 MCP tools**\n- `run_task`: Returns task_id, handles invalid inputs\n- `get_task_info`: Returns correct status and results\n- `get_task_logs`: Returns valid log path\n- `wait_next_event`: Blocks correctly, handles timeouts\n- `cleanup_task`: Removes files, optionally git refs\n\n### 4. Integration Tests (Real MicroVM)\n\n**End-to-end with actual VM**\n- Spawn VM with simple task (e.g., \"create a file called test.txt with 'hello'\")\n- Verify VM completes successfully\n- Verify result.json written correctly\n- Verify git commits merged back\n- Verify cleanup removes all artifacts\n\n**Error scenarios**\n- VM task that fails intentionally\n- VM that times out (if timeout implemented)\n- Merge conflict scenario\n\n## Test Infrastructure Needed\n\n1. pytest fixtures for mocking:\n   - Git repositories (temp dirs with git init)\n   - Nix build process\n   - VM process lifecycle\n\n2. Integration test fixtures:\n   - Real NixOS VM image (may need small test image)\n   - Isolated git repos for merge testing\n\n3. Test utilities:\n   - Async test helpers for event queue\n   - Thread-safe test assertions\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- All unit tests pass in \u003c 30 seconds\n- Integration tests pass (may take longer for VM boot)\n- Coverage \u003e 80% on core modules\n- Tests are truly atomic (no interdependencies)","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","owner":"turkka.mannila@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-30T10:35:19.017448+02:00","created_by":"Turkka Mannila","updated_at":"2026-01-30T10:54:09.149539+02:00","closed_at":"2026-01-30T10:54:09.149539+02:00","close_reason":"Decomposed into granular test issues with dependencies"}
{"id":"microvm-orchestrator-mcp-klc","title":"Create writable Nix store disk image for VM","description":"See nix_flake_plan.md for architecture overview.\n\nTOP PRIORITY: This is the foundational change that enables all other flake features.\n\n## Why this is critical\n- Current VM mounts host /nix/store as read-only\n- nix develop needs to write to /nix/store to build packages\n- Claude needs to modify flake.nix and rebuild during development\n\n## Implementation\n1. Create ext4 disk image for Nix store (or use microvm.nix volume support)\n2. Pass nixStoreDir path to VM build (similar to varDir, containerDir)\n3. Mount the disk image at /nix/store (writable)\n4. Configure Nix binary cache (cache.nixos.org) for fast package downloads\n5. Persist the store across tasks (per slot) to avoid re-downloading\n\n## Files to modify\n- nix/vm-config.nix\n- default.nix\n- src/microvm_orchestrator/core/vm.py\n- src/microvm_orchestrator/tools.py\n\n## Sizing\nStart with 20-50GB disk image (Nix store can grow large).
